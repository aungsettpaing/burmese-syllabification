# burmese-syllabification

## Introduction
This repository contains the code of segmenting the burmese texts into syllable units with two options - phonetical syllable units and orthographical syllable units.

## Medium Article
The logic behind this syllable segmentation is already explained with an article on [medium](https://aungsettpaing.medium.com/myanmar-syllabification-b5ba1d2d731e), which is written in Burmese. The direct link is provided just in case if you want to read.

## Request
If you have found something that I can update or add to this repository, you are most welcomed!
